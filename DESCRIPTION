Title: Main Effects and Interactions in Mixed and Incomplete Data
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Geneviève Robin
Maintainer: Genevieve Robin <genevieve.robin@polytechnique.edu>
Description: Generalized low-rank models for mixed and incomplete data frames. The main function may be used for dimensionality reduction of imputation of numeric, binary and count data (simultaneously). Main effects such as column means, group effects, or effects of row-column side information (e.g. user/item attributes in recommendation system) may also be modelled in addition to the low-rank model.
